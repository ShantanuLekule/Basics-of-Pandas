1 ........ Why Pandas?:

 1. Most important tool in data analysis and data science.
 2. Handles large amount of data.
 3. data cleaning/preparation.

# Data Structures of Pandas:

2 ........ 

  - data structures:
	1. Series
		- series is a one dimensional data structure.list, array, vector
	2. Data Frame
		- Data Frame is two dimensional data structure. data in the form rows and columns.
		- Also called collection of series.
	3. panel
		- three dimensional data structure.

# Basic Attributes of Pandas:

  1. shape: 
	- to know dimensions of data. df.shape
  2. columns:
	- to get column names.df.columns
  3. dtypes:
	- to know data types of all the feature.df.dtypes
  4. values:
	- to get array representation of feature. df['feature'].values

# Basic Functions in Pandas:

  1. head():
	- to get overview of data frame. first 5 rows.
  2. value_count():
	- returns frequecy table of any categorical feature.
  3. Describe():
	- to get descriptive statistic of numeric data.
  4. missing values:
	1. deletion: if the data is missing we can delete whole rows.
	2. Imputation: we can put any values in missing place.
  5. Type-casting:
	- to convert one data type to other.
  6. Adding and Deleting features:
	- to add new feature. df['name'] = df['values']
	- to drop feature. df.drop('name',axis = 1)
# Some smart operations of Pandas:

  1. filtering Data:
	- to get the data of specific type matching our requirements.
  2. Sort values:
	-  sorting values in data frame.sort_values()
  3. applying User-defined function on Series and Dataframe:

# Creating Groups in Pandas:

  1. Groupby in pandas:
	- if want a dataframe of value of a feature then we can use groupby. 
	1. Split: split data in various groups.
	2. apply: apply a function of splited data.
	3. combine: comnbine into a data structure.
# Basic Plots of Pandas:

  1. line plot
  2. bar plot
  3. pie plot
